This is my *fork* of the wxWidgets source code.

Try as I might I could not figure out how to get wxWidgets 3.0.2 from the github/wxWidgets repository (or a fork I created from it), so that (a) configure came out as version 3.0.2, and (b) the files bore a passing resemblance to the files in the wxWidgets-3.0.2.tar.bz2 available for "download" at https://www.wxwidgets.org/, and which wxAlien wanted to, and did, download (after jumping thru hoops).

So this repository contains a fresh "push" of the unziiped gzip file, followed by a commit of the changes made by wxAlien "patches", which begins my development history.
